## Introduction

In early 2024, we embarked on a project to help the general public better understand the city of Colombo and the impacts of various urban design interventions.  Our goal is to provide a visual and interactive tool for understanding urban design, infrastructure, and policy impacts in Colombo.

While professional expertise often resides in academic papers and reports, visualizing urban planning concepts can be challenging. Traditional software used for urban analysis, such as CUBE or OpenPaths, are complex and expensive. We chose to use Cities Skylines, a 2015 video game known for its complex and flexible urban simulation capabilities.

### Why Cities Skylines?

1. Cost-effective: $19.99 for a perpetual license vs. $6,000 â€“ 8,600 for an annual CUBE license
2. User-friendly: Designed for the general public
3. Superior visualization capabilities
4. Thriving modding community for extended functionality


## Features

- Accurate topographical representation of Colombo
- Detailed land use and zoning based on official city development plans
- Simulated population dynamics reflecting real-world demographics
- Implemented public transport routes (rail and bus)
- Customized visual assets to match Colombo's unique architectural style

### Limitations

- Maximum virtual population: 1,048,576 citizens
- Maximum area: 298.6 sq km
- Maximum buildings: 49,152
- Maximum vehicles in motion: 65,636
- Maximum parked vehicles: 65,636
- Maximum transport lines: 256

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Cities: Skylines game (base version)
- Required mods:
  - Realistic Population 2 (v2.2.2.4)
  - Lifecycle Rebalance Revisited (v1.6.8)
  - TM:PE (Traffic Manager: President Edition)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required mods in your Cities: Skylines game
3. Load the Colombo city save file in Cities: Skylines

## Usage

This simulation can be used to:

1. Visualize current urban design issues in Colombo
2. Test potential infrastructure changes
3. Explore impacts of policy decisions on traffic and population distribution
4. Educate students and the public about urban planning concepts

## Limitations

- Maximum population: 1,048,576 citizens
- Maximum area: 298.6 sq km
- Vehicle to population ratio: approximately 1:10 (real Colombo: 1:5)

## Contributing

While not a completely accurate simulation, this model provides a valuable platform for visualizing and understanding urban development changes. It addresses the challenge of communicating complex urban planning concepts to the general public, potentially reducing misunderstandings and social disruption when new urban development plans are proposed.

We present this tool in the hope that it will facilitate better communication and understanding of urban planning issues in Colombo.
