#Colombo: Skylines
by Nimesha Periyapperuma and Yudhanjaya Wijeratne

This repository contains Team Watchdog's simulation of the city of Colombo. This is an accurate topographical representation of Colombo, built with detailed land use and zoning based on official city development plans centererd around 2020; simulated population dynamics reflecting real-world demographics and human movement; public transport and population densites based on actual population mapping and route data; and curated visual assets to better match Colombo's unique architectural style.

This project is built with the use of data from the Sri Lanka Urban Development Authority and Department of Census and Statistics, from the University of Moratuwa's Department of Transport and Policy Planning, from META's Dat for Good projects, from UN-Habitat reports, from the studies conducted for the ComTRANs report. Special thanks to Professor Amal Kumarage, Dr. Amila Jayasinghe, Dr T Sivakumar for data, research, and contributions. This project would not exist without the knowledge and hard work from immensely talented modding community around Cities: Skylines: Andreas Pardeike, boformer, kian.zarrin, FireController#1847, LinuxFan, Krzychu1245, leftbehind, Bloodypenguin, algernon, Chamëleon TBN, and others listed in full in the mods section.

## Introduction

In early 2024, we embarked on a project to help the general public better understand the city of Colombo and the impacts of various urban design interventions.  Our goal is to provide a visual and interactive tool for understanding urban design, infrastructure, and policy impacts in Colombo.

While professional expertise often resides in academic papers and reports, visualizing urban planning concepts can be challenging. Traditional software used for urban analysis, such as CUBE or OpenPaths, are complex and expensive. We chose to use Cities Skylines, a 2015 video game known for its complex and flexible urban simulation capabilities.

### Why Cities Skylines?

1. Cost-effective: $19.99 for a perpetual license vs. $6,000 – 8,600 for an annual CUBE license
2. User-friendly: Designed for the general public
3. Superior visualization capabilities
4. Thriving modding community for extended functionality

## Getting Started
Refer the [Colombo Skylines Wiki](https://github.com/team-watchdog/colombo-skylines/wiki/Setting-up) to get started.

## Usage

This simulation can be used to:

1. Visualize current urban design issues in Colombo
2. Test potential infrastructure changes
3. Explore impacts of policy decisions on traffic and population distribution
4. Educate students and the public about urban planning concepts

While not a completely accurate simulation, this model provides a valuable platform for visualizing and understanding urban development changes. It addresses the challenge of communicating complex urban planning concepts to the general public, potentially reducing misunderstandings and social disruption when new urban development plans are proposed.

We present this tool in the hope that it will facilitate better communication and understanding of urban planning issues in Colombo.
